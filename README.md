## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Mikkel, and I'm a Copenhagen-based developer with a focus on all things Web. I primarily work in Typescript, React and Next.js. I also dabble in some C# from time to time.

I highly value working in environments where drive, passion and ownership are valued, collaborating with like-minded individuals developing cool things at a high pace.

As a big believer in Conway's law, I've spent a fair amount of time researching, coaching and hosting talks about psychological safety in software teams. You can find my work and resources at [AddressTheElephant.io](https://addresstheelephant.io/)

Outside of this, I'm a big enjoyer of all things music, mechanical keyboards, tabletop roleplaying games, and tinkering with my development setup in NeoVim.
